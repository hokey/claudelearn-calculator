# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ClaudeLearn is a simple TypeScript project for learning Claude Code capabilities. It demonstrates basic TypeScript compilation, testing with Jest, and code quality checks with ESLint.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist/` directory
- `npm start` - Runs the compiled application from `dist/index.js`
- `npm run dev` - Runs directly with ts-node (no compilation step)

### Testing
- `npm test` - Runs all Jest tests (files matching `**/*.test.ts`)
- `npm run test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode for development

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint on `src/**/*.ts` files

## Architecture

This is a modular TypeScript application with a simple structure:

- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` - Main application entry that imports and uses utilities
- **Utilities**: `src/utils/` - Contains utility classes and their tests (e.g., `calculator.ts` and `calculator.test.ts`)
- **Output**: `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by `tsc`)

### TypeScript Configuration

- Target: ES2020 with CommonJS modules
- Strict mode enabled with full type checking
- Source maps and declarations generated for debugging
- Test files (`**/*.test.ts`) excluded from compilation

### Testing Setup

- Jest with `ts-jest` preset for TypeScript support
- Tests colocated with source files (`.test.ts` suffix)
- Coverage collection enabled (excludes test files and type definitions)
